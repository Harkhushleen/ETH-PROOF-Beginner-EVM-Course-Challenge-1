DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple token contract implemented in Solidity.

FEATURES:
- Public variables to store token details (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
- Mapping to store balances of addresses
- Mint function to increase total supply and balance
- Burn function to decrease total supply and balance
- 
EXPLANATION:
This smart contract defines a simple token named "Challenge" with functions to manage its supply. It allows users to mint new tokens (increasing total supply) for a recipient address and burn tokens
(reducing total supply) from the sender's balance. The contract also stores public variables for the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
